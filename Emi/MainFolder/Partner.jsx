          Real Madrid C.F. is one of the most successful and recognized clubs in
          global football and has established itself as a major force in the
          sport. It's among the three founding members of the Spanish La Liga
          and has consistently played in the top division since inception. The
          team was founded in 1902, and since 1947 their home has been the
          Santiago Bernab√©u Stadium in downtown Madrid. Real Madrid holds the
          record for the most wins, draws, and goals scored in the UEFA Champions
          League and its previous name, European Cup. It's also the only club
          to achieve three consecutive tournament wins, twice over, and in 2022
          the team won its 14th title. Real Madrid is one of the most widely
          supported football clubs in the world, and we're proud to have been the
          team's Official Main Sponsor since 2011. Every year, we've created a
          new unique aircraft livery to celebrate our partnership. Both Real
          Madrid and Emirates use the power of sport as a vehicle to create
          moments of inspiration for fans.
